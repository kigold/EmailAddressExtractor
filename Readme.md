# Email Address Extractor

This is a console application that can read documentsfrom a directory and then extract the email address found in the documents

Currently the only supported document types are text files and word documents,
we are looking to also add support for Pdf documents

## Getting Started

First step is to download the code.

### Prerequisites

The application can be run using visual studio.
Just update the filepath in Program.cs file to the location of the directory where the files are located and then run

```
F5 on Visual Studio
```

## Future Improvements

- Output to text file
- Ability to run the project as an exe that would get filepath from args
- Support for PDF files
